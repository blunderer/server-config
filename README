# blunderer.org server management

# TOPLEVEL
-----------
This folder should only contain the master script (part of branch master).
It is used to populate all the sub repositories (stored as branches) into the current workspace.
It can also be used to sync / push changes for all sub repositories.

## WORKDIR
----------
This folder contains all docker applications management.
deploy.sh: script used to manage all docker container in one commannd.
manual.sh: script used to parse the docker apps README for clear text information
source: script to parse docker apps README for deploy.sh
'application'/: docker container descriptions.
	- README: description of container management
	- Dockerfile: Description of container internals
	- config: per container specific configuration files
	- resource: in-container management scripts

## CONFIGS
----------
This folder contains the host configuration files for several needed daemon like:
- ssh
- fail2ban

## BACKUP
---------
This folder contains the management of backups for blunderer.org docker containers.
- cron: cron configuration to be installed
- install.sh: install the relevant script and configure cron jobs
- scripts: utilities to perform incremental backup on the host

The script will backup as following:
- source of backup: /home/data
- destination of backup /home/backup
- list of remote destinations to backup to 

## SSL
- config: getssl configuration
- cron: cron configuration to be installed to auto renew SSL certificates with let's encrypt
- tools: script that packages and install resulting SSL certs for lighttpd and postfix

## DATA
-------
The containers expect a /home/data folder that contains:
- config: a key value store that will be reachable at creation time for each docker application 
- keys/$APP: per application folder that contains the secret keys to use
- users/$APP: per-application folder that contains login information to use
- List of per application volumes:
	- mysql
	- www

# HOWTO
--------
This section describes how to perform basic action using server-config repository.

## Checkout / Update / Commit
------------------------------
- Use ./config.sh to perform these actions directly

## Install local tools
-----------------------
The local tools required are:
- mail
- ssh
- fail2ban
- docker
- cron
- rsync
- git
- dig (dnsutils)
- getssl (https://github.com/srvrco/getssl.git): must be installed in $PATH

You also need to configure authorized_keys for master server to SSH with no password to secondaries.

## Configure SSL
---------------------
SSL is managed via getSSL and let's encrypt. Challenge is pushed to the
lighttpd server and all domains/subdomains will use the same acme server-root
for the challenge.

# for adding new domains, edit blunderer.org/getssl.conf and add new SANS
Then rsync the new folders to the DATA folder.

For installing a new server:
Run the command manually once for each domains:
$ getssl -w /home/data/getssl blunderer.org
If everything works well, install the CRON by running the install command.
$ install server=primary|secondary

This will attempt to renew SSL certificate every Friday at 5am

## Configure backups
---------------------
Go to the backup folder and run the install command:
$ install server=primary|secondary

This will automatically configure the following
- local backup daily at 4am localtime
- remote backup to all remote hosts at 3am localtime [on primary only]
- update machine OS at 1am localtime

## Configure remote monitoring
-------------------------------
